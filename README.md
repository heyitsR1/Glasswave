## 🧊 About the Project

> **Theme:** A modern, glassmorphic user interface  
> **Duration:** 3 weeks  
> **Team Size:** 3 students

We were initially inspired by this particular post on Dribbble.

Though we shifted from neumorphism to a more glass-like look, we'd like to credit the designer for the idea
